This app is a small server to serve as a GitHub Post-Receive hook to add 
comments, and update state in Pivotal Tracker, similar to say the Lighthouse
service integration.

Configure your Tracker API key, and Project ID in a config.yml file placed in 
the same directory as this app.  It should look something like:

tracker_api_token: a1230e72340e3babc96d5e2fab67c18d
tracker_project_id: 123

When you make commits to Git/GitHub, and want a comment and optionally a state 
update made to a story in Tracker, add the following text to your commit 
message:
    
    [Story#####]
    
or

    [Story##### state:finished]

where ##### is the story number (see the bottom of an expanded story in 
Tracker for its ID).

This project also requires the "rest-client" rubygem.
